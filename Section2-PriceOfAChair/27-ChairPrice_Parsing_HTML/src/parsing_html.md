# Parsing HTML of a Chair Page
1) go to https://www.johnlewis.com/philippe-starck-for-kartell-masters-chair/black/p326288
2) On the item price, click with the mouse right button, and select "Inspect Elemen"
3) You willl find something like this:
    * ```<p class="price price--large"> Â£177.00 </p>```
4) So we need to understand the HTML in the pages to be able to retreive information from it.
