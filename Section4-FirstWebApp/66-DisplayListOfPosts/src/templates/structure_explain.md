# base.html
* The other pages aren't  actually going to be pages, 
* **\<body\>**: the body of a html document is what is shown to the user.
* **\<head\>**: the head is what is not shown to the user, but can do things like import static files like CSS or JavaScript, it can do things like set the title of your page and things like descriptions and other things for Google to be able to index your page properly and things like that.
* In order to create pages reasonably easily we want avoid having to rewrite the head of the footer and every page, what we want to do is instead be able to simply say "this \<head\>  is going to be shared across all of our pages.
